== COMPANIES: CUSTOM FIELDS

=== List custom fields

As of now, there is no separate endpoint to list custom fields for the personal profile. However, you
can get all custom fields listed when you fetch custom field sections. Please refer to
<<companies-custom-field-sections-list,the corresponding section>> above.

=== Retrieve a custom field

As of now, you cannot fetch the details of a single custom field. As a workaround you can fetch all custom fields
as described above and then locate the one you are looking for in the returned collection.

=== Create a custom field

A `POST` request will create a new custom field for the company profile.

The new custom field will be placed at the end of the section and the `order` value will be automatically assigned.
