# LakePay
A scalable Core Banking System optimised for High Volume Workloads and Big Data

You will find in this repository the source code of LakePay, which was developed from 2024 onwards.

LakePay Cloud is a flexible and scalable Core Banking System which can be deployed within weeks, rather than within months or years for legacy Core Banking Systems. LakePay Cloud has a very user-centric interface, allowing financial institutions employees to perform their tasks efficiently. 

Functionalities, including all key front-office and back-office features, make the system ideal for Microfinance Institutions, Cooperative Financial Institutions, Digital lenders and medium-sized banks.
